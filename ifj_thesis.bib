  abstract={This paper provides a unified discussion of the Delaunay triangulation. Its geometric properties are reviewed and several applications are discussed. Two algorithms are presented for constructing the triangulation over a planar set ofN points. The first algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It runs inO(N logN) time, which is asymptotically optimal. The second algorithm is iterative and requiresO(N2) time in the worst case. However, its average case performance is comparable to that of the first algorithm.},

These n-simplices are the dual forms of the vertices in the commonly used Voronoi tessellation. Several efforts have been made to simulate the 2-dimensional Voronoi tessellation on the computer. Additional problems occur for the 3 and higher dimensional implementations but some of these can be avoided by alternatively computing the dual Delaunay tessellation. An algorithm that finds the topological relationships in these tessellations is given.},
